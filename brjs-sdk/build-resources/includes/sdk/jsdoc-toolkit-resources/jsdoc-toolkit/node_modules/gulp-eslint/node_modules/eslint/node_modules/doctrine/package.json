[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Constellation/doctrine.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Constellation/doctrine)\n\nIt is now used by content assist system of [Eclipse Orion](http://www.eclipse.org/orion/) ([detail](http://planetorion.org/news/2012/10/orion-1-0-release/))\n\nDoctrine can be used in a web browser:\n\n    <script src=\"doctrine.js\"></script>\n\nor in a Node.js application via the package manager:\n\n    npm install doctrine\n\nsimple example:\n\n    doctrine.parse(\n        [\n            \"/**\",\n            \" * This function comment is parsed by doctrine\",\n            \" * @param {{ok:String}} userName\",\n            \"*/\"\n        ].join('\\n'), { unwrap: true });\n\nand gets following information\n\n    {\n        \"description\": \"This function comment is parsed by doctrine\",\n        \"tags\": [\n            {\n                \"title\": \"param\",\n                \"description\": null,\n                \"type\": {\n                    \"type\": \"RecordType\",\n                    \"fields\": [\n                        {\n                            \"type\": \"FieldType\",\n                            \"key\": \"ok\",\n                            \"value\": {\n                                \"type\": \"NameExpression\",\n                                \"name\": \"String\"\n                            }\n                        }\n                    ]\n                },\n                \"name\": \"userName\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n\nsee [demo page](http://constellation.github.com/doctrine/demo/index.html) more detail.\n\n### Options\n\n#### doctrine.parse\nWe can pass options to `doctrine.parse(comment, options)`.\n```js\n{\n    unwrap: boolean,          // default: false\n    tags: [ string ] | null,  // default: null\n    recoverable: boolean,     // default: false\n    sloppy: boolean,          // default: false\n    lineNumbers: boolean      // default: false\n}\n```\n\n##### unwrap\n\nWhen `unwrap` is `true`, doctrine attempt to unwrap comment specific string from a provided comment text. (removes `/**`, `*/` and `*`)\nFor example, `unwrap` transforms\n```\n/**\n * @param use\n */\n```\nto\n```\n@param use\n```\nIf a provided comment has these comment specific strings, you need to specify this `unwrap` option to `true`.\n\n##### tags\n\nWhen `tags` array is specified, doctrine only produce tags that is specified in this array.\nFor example, if you specify `[ 'param' ]`, doctrine only produces `param` tags.\nIf null is specified, doctrine produces all tags that doctrine can recognize.\n\n##### recoverable\n\nWhen `recoverable` is `true`, doctrine becomes `recoverable` - When failing to parse jsdoc comment, doctrine recovers its state and attempt to continue parsing.\n\n##### sloppy\n\nWhen `sloppy` is `true`,\n```\n@param String [foo]\n```\n's `[foo]` is interpreted as a optional parameter, not interpreted as a name of this `@param`.\n\n##### lineNumbers\n\nWhen `lineNumbers` is `true`, parsed tags will include a `lineNumber` property indicating the line (relative to the start of the comment block) where each tag is located in the source. So, given the following comment:\n```\n/**\n * @param {String} foo\n * @return {number}\n */\n```\nThe `@param` tag will have `lineNumber: 1`, and the `@return` tag will have `lineNumber: 2`.\n\n\n### License\n\n#### doctrine\n\nCopyright (C) 2012 [Yusuke Suzuki](http://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](http://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.
