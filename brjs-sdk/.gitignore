# These ignores work such that they exclude files (not direcotries) using *, allowing only explicit includes to override this rule
# See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1248570/git-ignore-everything-except-subdirectory for details

# Note: DO NOT try to use a wildcard to ignore all of workspace. You can't unignore files whose parent directory is ignored.

# TODO: delete these lines when no longer needed -- these lines are needed to work around 2 separate bugs in the Java git implementation (EGit) provided with Eclipse Kepler
#   1. Egit doesn't currently support recursive wildcards (**) as used in the main brjs .gitignore
#   2. Egit currently won't consider recursive matches defined before a blanket block pattern, followed by negated block patterns (!), so is ignoring matches in the main brjs .gitignore
