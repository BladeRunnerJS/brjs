BladeRunnerJs Readme
=======================


Getting Started
---------------

 -  Open a terminal console in the sdk directory.

 -  In Windows run the command 'brjs serve', in Unix run the command './brjs serve'.

 -  Then open a web browser and point it to the URL http://localhost:7070/ to open the BladeRunner
    Dashboard.
 
 -  Further documentation is available from the BladeRunner Dashboard.
 
 -  You will need a modern browser to access the BladeRunner Dashboard (it doesn't support IE6, IE7
    or IE8).


Increasing JVM Resources
------------------------

 - BladeRunnerJS uses the default 'JAVA_OPTS' environment variable. The default operating system value for this
   is usually sufficient. If you experience "Out of Memory" errors, or wish to improve performance by allocating
   more memory, you can add the relevant options to the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. 


Thirdparty Licenses
-------------------

 -  BladeRunnerJS is comprised of several other Thirdparty libraries, both Java and JavaScript.
    Licenses for these Thirdparty libraries can be found alongside the library and your use of 
	them is governed by their respective terms.
