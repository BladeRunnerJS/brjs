 * @classdesc
 * The <code>Serializable</code> interface is implemented by classes that provide a mechanism
 * to serialize their state and recreate instances from a serialized form.
 *
 * <p>The only restriction on the serialized form is that it is a string.  A class may change
 * its serialized form, however if it does so and wishes to maintain backwards compatibility
 * with current serialized forms, it will need the deserialize method to cope with multiple
 * different versions of serialized form.  For this reason, it's good practice to put the
 * serialization version at the beginning of the serialized form.
 *
 * <p>It is not the responsibility of a Serializable class to include its classname in its
 * serialized form.
