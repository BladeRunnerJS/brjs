## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

### @tagVersion@ Features and Improvements

- Some minor JavaScript library improvements around Presenter library validators, formatters and parsers to:
 - Support case-insensitive date parsing
 - Optionally parse ambiguous dates to the end of the month or year.
 - Move formatters and validators into their own libraries. *This is backwardsly compatible and the old require paths are still valid*
- The CSS filename now precedes the content within the CSS bundle to make it easier to find the file which supplied the content.
- Fixed a bug where assets within Blades with no BladeSet where not re-namespaced properly when an App was imported.
