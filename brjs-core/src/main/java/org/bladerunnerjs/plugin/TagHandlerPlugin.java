/**
 * Tag handler plug-ins allow BladeRunnerJS tags within index pages (e.g. <code>&lt;@bundle.js/@&gt;</code>) to be replaced with arbitrary content.
 * 
 * <p>Tag handlers are often used to cause the browser to make requests to a {@link ContentPlugin}, using the
 * {@link ContentPlugin#getContentPathParser} and {@link ContentPathParser#createRequest} methods to help generate valid content paths. Similar to
 * {@link ContentPlugin} instances, tag-handler plug-ins should be deterministic, in that they generate the same content each time they are run.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Although tag-handler plug-ins are designed to be usable both dynamically, and as part of a build (for flat-file export), a provision for generating different content in
 * development and production is provided, for cases where things need to be done in a more efficient manner in production, and in a more dev-friendly manner in
 * development. Developers that choose to exploit this facility should take care to ensure there is no chance of bugs being found in production, that can't also be observed
 * in development; a core tenet of BladeRunnerJS.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The following methods are <i>identifier-methods</i>, and may be invoked before {@link Plugin#setBRJS Plugin.setBRJS()}
 * has been invoked:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #getTagName}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getGroupName}</li>
 * </ul>
