/**
 * <p>
 * Content plug-ins allow generated content to be returned by the application server in response to requests from the web browser. Where content
 * plug-ins differ from similar mechanisms employed on most other application servers is that they are required to support flat-file export, and
 * so must therefore have the following properties:</p>
 * 
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>Determinism</dt>
 *   <dd>The same response must always be returned given the same request and the same set of files on disk.</dd>
 *   
 *   <dt>Discoverability</dt>
 *   <dd>The complete list of valid content paths must be provided by content plug-ins on demand (using {@link #getValidDevContentPaths getValidDevContentPaths()} &amp;
 *   {@link #getValidProdContentPaths getValidProdContentPaths()}), such that any requests from the browser that are not included in this list are considered to be an
 *   error.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * 
 * <p>Although content-plugins are designed to be usable both dynamically, and as part of a build (for flat-file export), a provision for generating different content in
 * development and production is provided, for cases where things need to be done in a more efficient manner in production, and in a more dev-friendly manner in
 * development. Developers that choose to exploit this facility should take care to ensure there is no chance of bugs being found in production, that can't also be observed
 * in development; a core tenet of BladeRunnerJS.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The following methods are <i>identifier-methods</i>, and may be invoked before {@link Plugin#setBRJS Plugin.setBRJS()} has been invoked:</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #getRequestPrefix}</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getGroupName}</li>
