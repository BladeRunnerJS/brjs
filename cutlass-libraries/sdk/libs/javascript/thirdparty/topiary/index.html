	<h1>Topiary</h1>
	<p>
		Topiary is a microlibrary providing tree and shape-based type verification for JavaScript.
	</p>

	<h2>Details</h2>
	<p>
		You can see the specification <a href="specs">here</a>, or the git repository <a href="https://github.com/caplin/topiary">here</a>.
		This page has the library loaded so you can experiment by opening up a console.
	</p>

	<p>
		This library provides:
		<ul>
		<li>
			<code>topiary.extend(subclass, superclass)</code> which implements classical single inheritance by setting up the prototype chain.
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>topiary.implement(class, interface)</code> which declares that a class implements an interface and throws an exception if it does not.
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>topiary.inherit(class, parent)</code> which provides multiple inheritance by copying functionality from the parent to the class.
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>topiary.mixin(class, mixin)</code> which provides mixin inheritance, sandboxing mixin methods that are copied onto the class.
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>topiary.isA(instance, parent)</code> which returns true if the instance is of a type which has been declared to be descended from the parent, e.g. because it's extended or implemented or mixed-in.
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>topiary.isAssignableFrom(class, parent)</code> which returns true if the class has been declared to be descended from the parent, e.g. through extension, implementation, etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>topiary.fulfills(instance, interface)</code> which returns true if the instance supports everything on the interface.
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>topiary.classFulfills(class, interface)</code> which returns true if instances of the class will be created supporting everything on the interface.
		</li>
		</ul>
		Please see the <a href="specs">specifications</a> and <a href="doc/topiary.html">code documentation</a> for more details.
	</p>
	<p>
		The following convenience methods are also provided:
		<ul>
		<li>
			<code>topiary.install()</code> which copies the appropriate methods onto the Function and Object prototype, renaming them where appropriate.  This lets you do things like <code>Subclass.extends(Superclass)</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>topiary.export()</code> which copies the appropriate methods onto the global object so they can be accessed directly.
		</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h2>A Note on implementation</h2>
	<p>
		This library makes liberal use of nonenumerable attributes and Object.getPrototypeOf.
		It is therefore suitable only for ecmascript 5 engines.  It will work in ecmascript 6
		engines but there would be a much nicer implementation in that case, using Map and
		private symbols.
	</p>
