## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@ contains code refactoring and minor enhancements.

### Enhancements

- A boolean has been added to `br.presenter.node.Field` to represent when validation is pending / completed.
- The utility class `br.i18n.I18nStore` has been added to `br.i18n.Translator`, this will prevent circular dependencies when running in WebPack. 

### Removing Redundant Code

- Now that older versions of Internet Explorer are no longer supported by BRJS, thirdparty libraries containing shims and shivs have been removed from the codebase. If for any reason you still require these libraries we suggest you add them to your apps libs directory.

### Backwards Compatibility Issues

- The changes to `br.i18n.Translator` may result in errors in tests which previously accessed the private messages map of this class. It is recommended that in tests you add i18n properties file to the resourcecs directory for any tokens you wish to override in tests.
