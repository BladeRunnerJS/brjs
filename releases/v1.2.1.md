## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@ is a patch release containing minor bugfixes to the i18n library and a new command to check for missing i18n.

- fixed a bug where apps with missing translations were not loading in IE8/9 due to window.console not being defined.

#### New I18n Command

The new `check-i18n` command will print to the console any i18n tokens which are being used by the app but do not appear in any translation files. It will also generate a CSV file containing all tokens, translations for each locale and whether they are being used in the application.
