## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@
Our first major milestone containing a number of bug fixes, improvements and new features.

Release highlights include:

- NodeJS style App source code support
- Improved BRJS model and plugin interfaces
- The BRJS model now uses the Java7 File Watcher Service to enabled caching and minimise the amount of dependency analysis that has to be executed
- The `CompositeBundler` plugin now allows both NamespacedJS and NodeJS style source code to be used in the same App
- `CSSBundler` plugin uses the new BRJS model
- `XMLBundler` and `HTMLBundler` changed to use the new model and plugin interfaces
- Basic support for NodeJS libraries
- Integrated JSTestDriver to use the new BRJS model to generate test bundles
- A number of other bug fixes and minor improvements

### Known Issues
- Due to some EcmaScript5 uses BRJS does not currently support IE8
  - **Workaround:** There is no workaround but this is something we will fix in the near future
- CPU usage issues when BRJS server is left running for a prolonged period of time
  - **Workaround:** Restart the BRJS server once every 30-60 minutes
- The `CSSResource` plugin is not fully implemented. As a result images are not available in workbenches and exports WARs.
  - **Workaround:** Images can be referenced using an absolute URL to load them directly from disk rather than via the BRJS 'bundling' mechanism
- Due to the latency of the File Watch Service on OSX it can sometimes take several seconds for changes to files to be picked up when a page is refreshed
  - **Workaround:** Either wait a few seconds and refresh the page again, or if you're in a hurry just restart the BRJS server
- Due to a [bug in Java]((http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8029516)), the JVM can occasionally crash on Windows when BRJS attempts to close File Watchers.
  - **Workaround:** Unfortunately there is no workaround. Oracle are aware of the issue and we will also be making changes to aleviate the issue in a future release
