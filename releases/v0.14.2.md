## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

### @tagVersion@ Features and Improvements

The following changes were made in 0.14.2:

  * We no longer leave open read-locks on XML and I18N configuration files.
  * We've added backwards compatibility support for the `appNamespace` property within 'app.conf', so that existing motif zips can continue to be imported into BladeRunnerJS.
  * We fixed a couple of bugs within our client-side locale switching code, so that it now works as best as it can in all browsers.
  * We fixed a regression that was introduced into the `ValidSelectionValidator` class in 0.14.1.

### Known Issues

When switching between a workbench and an app, the alias blob will occasionally point at an incorrect class. Refreshing the page usually corrects the problem.
