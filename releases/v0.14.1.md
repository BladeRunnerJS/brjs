## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

### @tagVersion@ Features and Improvements

The following changes were made in v0.14.1:

  * We now make use of the recursive file-watching support available within Windows to more efficiently watch large directory trees, avoiding the file locking and performance issues encountered when separately listening to each directory. This feature relies on features available only within the Oracle & OpenJDK implementations of the JRE.
  * We now make use of high-sentivity polling for file-watching on Mac OS X, reducing the latency between when a file is actually changed and when the notification of that file change is received. This feature relies on features available only within the Oracle & OpenJDK implementations of the JRE.
  * Browser modules have been updated so they no longer include their own shims, making it possible for applications to decide on the shims they wish to use.
  * Fixed a recently introduced bug in the test-runner that caused some test names to be incorrectly displayed.
  * A caching bug, introduced in v0.14, that required `brjs serve` to be restarted if an alias was updated to point to a new class, has now been fixed.


### Backwards Compatibility Issues

This following additional backwards compatibility issues have been introduced with the relase of v0.14.1:

  * `ServiceRegistry.clear()` has been renamed to `ServiceRegistry.legacyClear()` to prevent it from being automatically invoked before each test is run.

#### Clearing the Service Registry

The [browser-modules](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/browser-modules) library includes a [sub-realms](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/browser-modules#sub-realms) feature that better addresses the need for tests to override module definitions and module state, but which would be too expensive to automatically employ within all tests.

Although we ultimately recommend that tests are migrated to make use of _sub-realms_ where appropriate, particularly as code-bases migrate to CommonJs, for the time being clients can work around this restriction by creating a file containing the following code at `BRJS_ROOT/js-patches/br/ServiceRegistryClass.js`:

``` js
ServiceRegistryClass.prototype.clear = ServiceRegistryClass.prototype.legacyClear;
```


### Known Issues

This patch release fixes the remaining four known issues present within v0.14.
