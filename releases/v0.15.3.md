## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

### @tagVersion@ Features and Improvements

- Fix for an issue where some virus scanners could cause the bundle time for apps to drastically increase when the Java 7 file watcher was used.
 - A polling file change observer can be used by setting the value of 'fileObserver' in `brjs.conf` to 'polling:X' where X is the poll interval. For example 'polling:1000'.
- Fixed a bug where an exception was thrown my the MimeMagic library when importing an app.
- Minor changes to the `LocalisedDateParser`.
