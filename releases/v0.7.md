## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@
- Fixed export-app command (#508)
- Improvements to the JsTestDriver config options for all bundlers
- Fixed several dependency-caching bugs
- Several other minor bug fixes
- Improvements to the Spec Test API

### Compatibility Issues
- All JsTestDriver.conf files in existing applications need to update their plugin config for the 'module' value:
```
plugin:
  - name: "BundleInjector"
    jar: ../../../../sdk/libs/java/testRunner/js-test-driver-bundler-plugin.jar
    module: com.caplin.jstestdriver.plugin.CutlassBundleInjectorPlugin
```
To
```
plugin:
  - name: "BundleInjector"
    jar: ../../../../sdk/libs/java/testRunner/js-test-driver-bundler-plugin.jar
    module: org.bladerunnerjs.jstestdriver.BRJSBundleHandler
```

### Known Issues
- CPU usage issues when BRJS server is left running for a prolonged period of time. This appears to be an OSX only issue.
  - **Workaround:** Restart the BRJS server once every 30-60 minutes
- The `CSSResource` plugin is not fully implemented. As a result images are not available in workbenches.
  - **Workaround:** Images can be referenced using an absolute URL to load them directly from disk rather than via the BRJS 'bundling' mechanism
- Due to the latency of the File Watch Service on OSX it can sometimes take several seconds for changes to files to be picked up when a page is refreshed
  - **Workaround:** Either wait a few seconds and refresh the page again, or if you're in a hurry just restart the BRJS server
