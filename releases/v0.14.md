## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

### @tagVersion@ Features and Improvements

  * The [AppCache plugin](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs-appcache) has been added to the BRJS project as a _contrib_ plugin.
  * A new _inline_ plug-in is available that allows arbitrary files to be in-lined within the index page, allowing the [critical rendering path](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/) to be optimized.
  * A new `RequirePlugin` plug-in interface has been provided that can be used to allow arbitrary asset-types or _things_ to be required.
  * CommonJs modules can now require aliased classes and and services by requiring them, for example `require('alias!the-alias')` and `require('service!the-service')`.
  * We no longer bundle CSS resources unless they are referred to by CSS stylesheets that are actually used within the application.
  * We changed how we communicate which assets need to be bundled, to facilitate the _App-Cache_ plug-in, which needs to know about all assets, regardless of whether they will end up being bundled or not.
  * Exceptions now show a friendly error message for any known errors, and call-stacks are now only shown for unanticipated errors.
  * The state of the _presentation-model_ tree-view workbench widget is now maintained between page reloads.
  * BRJS now uses the latest version of [topiarist](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/topiarist), which includes minor performance improvements and some bug fixes for IE8.
  * The [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) tool, which is used for minification within BladeRunnerJS, was updated so it no longer incorrectly complains about the usage of the the subset of ES3 _reserved-words_ that are no longer reserved within ES5.
  * The `unbundled-resources` directory can now appear within aspects, blades, bladesets & workbenches, etc.
  * The `Content-Length` header set by WARs built with BRJS is now always sent, even when used with application servers that try to set the header themselves (e.g. WebSphere).
  * We fixed a bug that caused the XML namespace in the `WEB-INF/web.xml` file to be lost when building a WAR.
  * A number of minor bug fixes and improvements were made to the `presenter` and `testing` libraries, which are detailed in more details in the the fixed issues and pull requests at the bottom of these release notes.


#### In-line Plugin

The new in-line tag-handler plug-in can be used by adding a tag like this to your index page:

```
<@inline file="path-to-file" @/>
```


#### Unbundled Resources

The following additional request forms are now available:

  * `unbundled-resources/<file-path>` (_for aspect/app resources_)
  * `unbundled-resources/bladeset_<bladeset>/<file-path>` (_for bladeset resources_)
  * `unbundled-resources/bladeset_<bladeset>/blade_<blade>/<file-path>` (_for blade resources_)
  * `unbundled-resources/bladeset_<bladeset>/blade_<blade>/workbench/<file-path>` (_for blade workbench resources_)


### Backwards Compatibility Issues

There were no backwards compatibility for apps using BRJS, but there were changes to some of the plug-in interfaces that will affect plug-ins developed for BRJS.

#### Content Plugin API

The following changes were made to the `ContentPlugin` interface:

  * The `getValidDevContentPaths()` and `getValidProdContentPaths()` methods have been merged into a single `getValidContentPaths()` method that takes a `RequestMode` parameter.
  * A new `getUsedContentPaths()` method was added to facilitate the _app-cache_ plug-in, but classes that extend `AbstractContentPlugin` will likely not need to implement this, as a default implementation is provided. This method is used to determine, out of the possible content paths, which are used in the app, and so should be part of the built app.



#### Tag Handler Plugin API

The following changes were made to the `TagHandlerPlugin` interface:

  * The `getGeneratedDevRequests()` and `getGeneratedProdRequests()` methods have been merged into a single `getGeneratedContentPaths()` method that takes a `RequestMode` parameter.
  * The `writeDevTagContent()` and `writeProdTagContent()` methods have been merged into a single `writeTagContent()` method that takes a `RequestMode` parameter.


### Known Issues

The following known issues exist as of v0.14:

  * On Windows it's not possible to rename or delete non-leaf directories beneath `BRJS_ROOT` when `brjs serve` is running, as a result of the _file-watch_ service. You must temporarily stop `brjs serve` when you need to do this.
  * On Windows there are occasionally file locking issues believed to be as a result of the Windows _file-watch_ service.
  * On MacOS X using Java 7 it can take a few seconds for the _file-watch_ service to notice that files have changed. This means changes may not appear the first time you refresh the browser. You can solve this by upgrading to Java 8, which adds support for the native Mac OS X _file-watch_ service.
