## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@ contains enhancements and minor bug fixes.

### Bug Fixes

- `br.parsing.LocalisedAmountParser` has been updated to use BigNumber to fix rounding errors when parsing some values.
- `br.util.Observable` now uses typeof in place of intanceof to avoid errors when using some classes used by downstream projects.

### Enhancements

- The version of Jetty packaged with BRJS has been upgraded to 9.4.6. This version contains a fix to an issue which caused bad requires to throw ServletExceptions in the browser when using our dev server.
- `br.presenter.testing.PresentationModelFixture` now has `setPMMappings` method to support editing Presenter Mappings in acceptance tests.
- The version of Selenium packaged with BRJS has been upgraded to 3.4.0.

### Backwards Compatability

- Changes to `br.util.Observable` will mean that any observers which are primitives instantiated using `new` (e.g. new String) will fail the type check.
