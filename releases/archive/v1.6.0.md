## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@ contains full Java 8 support and new features.

##### Java 8

BRJS was previously built and compiled with Java 8 but distributed to run against Java 7+. This is the first release that targets Java 8. We advise users to upgrade their Java versions to 8 and to ensure prod servers are upgraded where necessary.

### Enhancements

- `br.AliasRegistryClass` format has been simplified and now allows inline alias registration.
- The version of Selenium that is shipped with BRJS has been upgraded to 3.0.1. 
- The Jetty version, which BRJS uses as a dev server, has been upgraded to 9.4.2.
