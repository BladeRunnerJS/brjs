## BladeRunnerJS 1.0.1

BRJS 1.0.1 fixes a major bug in BRJS 1.0 which prevented locale redirection working in IE. It also includes several other minor bugs fixes and improvements.

#### Strict mode warning in IE

BRJS 1.0 introduced a change where the HTML template service uses `template` tags across all browsers. To enable this in IE8+ it includes a shim which requires the browser to be in strict mode. A bug was introduced where the internal redirection page wasn't in strict mode which prevent multi locale apps working in IE*. This is fixed in 1.0.1.

#### Other minor fixes + improvements

- BRJS no longer incorrectly determines test folder paths if an empty `test` directory exists inside of a test location
- Warnings can now be hidden with the `-q` flag. With this flag only `error` level messages will be displayed.
- The bundled `Emitr` microlibrary has been updated to show errors thrown by event handlers rather than swallowing them.
- Presenter `Parser`s no longer go in to an infinite loop if a value is `NaN`.
- Presenter `OptionsNodeList.getOptionByLabel()` now supports an `ignoreCase` argument
- Presenter `Parser`s can now be removed from `EditableProperty`s.
- `TimeoutUtility` now supports timeouts within timeouts.
- `index.jsp` can now send redirects using `response.sendRedirect()`.
