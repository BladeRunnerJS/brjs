## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@
- The JS bundler now ignores any dependencies defined in Javascript comments (#309)
- Added a new dependency analysis command `bundle-deps <bundlable-dir>` to analyse dependencies for any given 'bundlable' directory, see [here](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/wiki/Debugging-your-application-dependencies#brjs-bundle-deps) for details
- BRJS now makes use of linked HashMaps to guarantee that the bundling ordering is deterministic and the same each time (#474)
- Improved error feedback when reading library.manifest contents. Exceptions are now thrown if files or dependency libraries don't exist (#372)
- Fixed an issue where other libraries were being included before BRJS bootstrap (#471)
- Plugins now have the ability to define their order relative to other plug-ins in the BRJS system through the introduction of an `OrderedPlugin` interface (#461)
- Aliases can now be referenced within XML tags and have their dependencies bundled (#479)

### Known Issues
- CPU usage issues when BRJS server is left running for a prolonged period of time. This appears to be an OSX only issue.
  - **Workaround:** Restart the BRJS server once every 30-60 minutes
- The `CSSResource` plugin is not fully implemented. As a result images are not available in workbenches.
  - **Workaround:** Images can be referenced using an absolute URL to load them directly from disk rather than via the BRJS 'bundling' mechanism
- Due to the latency of the File Watch Service on OSX it can sometimes take several seconds for changes to files to be picked up when a page is refreshed
  - **Workaround:** Either wait a few seconds and refresh the page again, or if you're in a hurry just restart the BRJS server
