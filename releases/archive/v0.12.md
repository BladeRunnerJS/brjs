- Alias namespaces are now correctly enforced
  - **This is a breaking change, see below**
- Sub themes are now supported
  - A theme can now extend another by using the format `<parent>-<variant>`
- A new command has been created which allows copying themes to a new name
- Thirdparty libraries will no longer be wrapped in a 'define' block based on the presence of a `package.json`
  - **This is a breaking change, see below**


#### 'default' Aspect is no longer needed

- The `default-aspect` folder at the root level of your application is now optional. Aspect files and folders for the 'default' Aspect are now supported directly at the root level of your application, for example:

```
 apps/someCoolApp
 ├── app.conf             # Application configuration
 ├── index.html           # Application entry point
 ├── src                  # app-level JavaScript
 ├── resources            # other app resources
 ├── themes               # CSS and images
 ├── libs                 # app libraries
 ├── unbundled-resources  # Assets that shouldn't be minified and bundled
```

- The above is now the default structure for any newly created applications
- Previously created applications which only made use of the 'default Aspect can migrate their application to this structure by moving all of the folder contents up to the application folder
- This change does not break backwards compatability so any existings apps with a `default-aspect` will continue to behave as before, however having both the `default-aspect` folder and aspect files directly in the app folder is not supported

#### Optional BladeSet

- A BladeSet is no longer needed in order to create Blades. Blades without a parent BladeSet can live inside a `blades` directory directly inside an app.
- To create a new Blade without a parent BladeSet via the CLI use the command `./brjs create-blade <app-name> default <blade-name>`. In a future release the need for 'default' will be removed.
- The require prefix for Blades inside the 'default' Bladeset is `<app-require-prefix>/<blade-name`


#### Optional package directories

- Package directories are no longer needed within 'src' directories. For example: in previous releases the path to a file inside a Blade's `src` directory was `myBlade/src/<app-requirePrefix>/<bladeset-name>/<blade-name>/MyBladeClass.js`. The `<app-requirePrefix>/<bladeset-name>/<blade-name>` part of this path is now implicitly added, this means the require path to a Blade class is still `<app-requirePrefix>/<bladeset-name>/<blade-name>/MyBladeClass.js` but `MyBladeClass.js` can live at `<blade>/src/MyBladeClass.js`
- Classes can stil live within sub packages, the implicit require prefix will be prepended. For example, the class `myBlade/src/bladePackage/subPackage/MyBladeClass.js` will have a require path of `<app-requirePrefix>/<bladeset-name>/<blade-name>/bladePackage/subPackage/MyBladeClass.js`
- This change is 100% backwards compatible, classes can still have the explicit package directories

### Themes can now extend other themes

- Themes can now extend one another using the format `<parent>-<variant>`
- For example, an app may have the theme `red` and the sub themes `red-dark` and `red-light`. When `red-dark` is used as a theme in the `css.bundle` tag (`<@css.bundle theme="red-dark" @/>`) the `red` theme bundle will be loaded follow by the `red-dark` theme bundle. This allows the `red` theme to contain common 'red' styling and the `red-dark` and `red-light` themes to contain variants on their parent theme.
- Themes in the format `<something>-<anotherthing>` can still be used without requiring a parent theme to be present, however a warning will be logged

### Improved JSDoc

- BRJS has been updated to use the latest `master` version of JSDoc toolkit 3
- Performance when generating docs for large apps has improved. Thanks to @hegemonic for the help on this.
- JSDoc styling has been updated and improved.
- The BRJS API documentation hosted at http://apidocs.bladerunnerjs.org has been updated to use the new styling
- The command `./brjs jsdoc <app-name>` makes use of all changes made to JSDoc generation

### Compatibility Issues

#### 1. Alias namespace rules are now more strict

- Previously Alias namespaces were not properly enforced which meant an alias name could be defined outside of a Blade; BladeSet or Library namespace. This enforcement is now properly enforced.
  - BladeSet Aliases must have the format `<app-require-prefix>.<bladeset-name>.*`
  - Blade Aliases must have the format `<app-require-prefix>.<bladeset-name>.<blade-name>.*`
  - Library Aliases must have the format `<library-require-prefix>.*`
- Any Aliases not conforming to the above rules will generate an exception when the App is loaded

#### 2. '.js-style' file contents have changed

- The JS style representing CommonJS classes has changed from `node-js` to `common-js`. Any instances of `node-js` inside `.js-style` files should change to `common-js`.
- This change only affects apps that make use of the `NamespacedJS` JavaScript style

#### 3. Thirdparty libraries no longer wrapped in a 'define' block is `package.json` is present

- Previous Thirdparty libraries were wrapped in a 'define' block during the bunding process is a `package.json` file was present in the library
- `commonjsDefinition: true` is now required in `thirdparty-lib.manifest` instead to produce the same behaviour
- If NamespacedJS style classes are used anywhere in the application Thirdparty libraries are also now globalised using the name of the library rather than the value of the `exports`. The value of `exports` is still used when you `require()` the library.

#### 4. Changes to `build-app` command

- The build app command has changed so it no longer creates an extra nested directory if the `<target-dir>` argument is provided
- For example `./brjs build-app myApp target` previously built the app in `target/myApp`, it will now be built to `target`
