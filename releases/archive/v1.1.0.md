## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@ contains a number of new features along with several bug fixes.

### Token replacements can be defined using property files

App tokens (e.g. `@XXX.YYY.ZZZ@`) can now be provided using `.properties` files, in addition to the existing JNDI mechanism. This finally makes it easy for non J2EE apps to provide differentiated deployments for _dev_ & _prod_, etc. Additionally, tokens can now be placed into any file, rather than the limited number of file types previously supported &mdash; see [Using App Tokens](http://bladerunnerjs.org/docs/use/app_tokens/) for more information.

#### Ambiguous Tokens

Since tokens are now processed in all JavaScript files this can sometimes lead to exceptions where libraries use a BRJS token like string for a different use from BRJS tokens. See http://bladerunnerjs.org/docs/use/app_tokens/#token-format-ambiguity for more information and libraries known to have this issue.

### Favicon Support

Favicons (`.favicon` files) located in the root of the app are now served up correctly instead of returning a `404` response.

### JS libraries have been converted to CommonJS

The last few remaining libraries have been converted to [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/), and are no longer written using namespaced style formatting. This will improve the speed of the dependency analysis, since calculating the dependencies for CommonJS is much quicker. It will also remove the need to globalise all modules to support those remaining namespaced modules. To see any benefits your app must also be changed so that it is entirely composed of CommonJS modules.

While this doesn't cause any backwards compatibility issues with public API, it will likely cause any patches you have (files within `js-patches`) to break. Fixing these simply requires you to stop fully qualifying the class name in your patches too (e.g. `PresentationModel` instead of `br.presenter.PresentationModel`). Ideally, a pull request against the main code-base should be also be raised, since patches are intended for temporary changes only.

### Bug Fixes & Minor Improvements

The following bug fixes and improvements were also made in this release:

- `_` characters are now supported in version strings supplied via the `-v` flag.
- Cutom error pages configured via `web.xml` are now used correctly in the BRJS development server.
- Performance issues in tests, created in v1.0 by a change to use `<template>` tags in the HTML resource service, have been fixed.
- The `brjs` script works correctly in the latest version of GitBash.
- The `test` command now works correctly with symlinks on \*nix.
- A bug that could cause some CSS resources to not appear in the WAR has been fixed.
- A bug that caused a stackoverflow in IE8 when tests used multiple `continuesFrom()` calls has been fixed. 
- Fields prefixed with `m_` or `_` are now treated as _private_ within Presenter view models, and will not be used when calculating child nodes and traversing the model tree.
- Several BRJS microlibraries shipped within BladeRunnerJS have been updated. [Fell](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/fell/releases) has been updated to [v0.1.3](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/fell/releases/tag/v0.1.3), [Topiarist](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/topiarist/releases) to [v0.1.4](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/topiarist/releases/tag/v0.1.4) and [Emitr](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/emitr/releases) to [v0.0.8](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/emitr/releases/tag/v0.0.8).
