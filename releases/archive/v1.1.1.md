## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@ is a patch release containing two changes.

- `fell` has been upgraded to v0.1.3. The upgrade contains a backward compatability fix as well as an improvement to the `onLog()` callback which makes it easier to use mocking frameworks during tests.
- A `ServiceRegistry.dispose()` utility method has been added which calls `dispose()` on any services within the registry that implement a `dispose()` method. `ServiceRegistry.dispose()` should be used to clean up any services after an app has been 'unloaded' &mdash; this is particularly important for apps that may need to clean up resources on logout or apps, which use popout windows that share state with the parent window.
