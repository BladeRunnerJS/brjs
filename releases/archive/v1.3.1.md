## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@ contains a number of bug fixes including a fix that reduces the likelihood of a `NullPointerException` which occasionally happens when refreshing an app in development.

### Fixed Bugs

- A fix has been provided to improve an issue where a `NullPointerException` causes apps to error when refreshing the page in the dev environment.
- Fixed a bug where apps could not be imported when using the same namespace as the original.
- Fixed a bug that caused the dashboard to load slowly.
- A clearer error message is now shown when `test-runner.conf` does not have any browsers defined for a particular OS.
- Fixed a compatibility issue in `Fell` where `Utils` were not accessible.
