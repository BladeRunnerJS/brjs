## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

### @tagVersion@ Features and Improvements

The following changes were made in @tagVersion@:

- Topiarist has been updated to include a bug-fix so `topiarist.implement()` can be used to implement interfaces that have static constants defined on them.
- A fix for a `ConcurrentModificationException` that sometimes occured when creating a new app using the BRJS dashboard.
- A fix for a known issue in v0.14.2 where switching between a Blade workbench and an App caused the incorrect alias to be loaded in the App.
- The dashboard's import `Motif` dialog window now doesn't immediately close if there has been an error.

### Known Issues

BladeRunnerJS has the following known issues:

  * To allow deployment as a set of static files, locale switching was switched from the server to the browser in BladeRunnerJS 0.9, yet only Firefox 32 and Chrome 32 make the full set of `ACCEPT_LANGUAGE` headers available on the client (other browsers provide only a single language), which may cause a user to see the default language if their preferred language is unavailable, even though one of their secondary preferences may have been available.
