## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

### @tagVersion@ Features and Improvements

The following changes were made in @tagVersion@:

- Topiarist has been updated to include a bug-fix so `topiarist.implement()` can be used to implement interfaces that have static constants defined on them.
- A fix for a `ConcurrentModificationException` that sometimes occured when creating a new app using the BRJS dashboard.
- A fix for a known issue in v0.14.2 where switching between a Blade workbench and an App caused the incorrect alias to be loaded in the App.
- The dashboard's import `Motif` dialog window now doesn't immediately close if there has been an error.

### Backwards Compatibility Issues

The following additional backwards compatibility issues have been introduced with the release of v1.0:

- Given/When/Then style acceptance tests are no longer allowed to optionally omit the whitespace either side of the equals character. We've yet to find any tests that made use of this optional facility, so we hope this change will have a very limited impact.
   
### Known Issues

BladeRunnerJS has the following known issues:

  * To allow deployment as a set of static files, locale switching was switched from the server to the browser in BladeRunnerJS 0.9, yet only Firefox 32 and Chrome 32 make the full set of `ACCEPT_LANGUAGE` headers available on the client (other browsers provide only a single language), which may cause a user to see the default language if their preferred language is unavailable, even though one of their secondary preferences may have been available.
