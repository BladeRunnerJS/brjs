## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@
- JNDI token support for WAR files build with BRJS

### Compatibility Issues

#### 1. The PluginAccessor method names for accessing plug-ins have been renamed to always have work 'Plugin' appear within them.

Not doing this was awkward for some of the methods, and it was better to instead provide a consistent set of method names.


#### 2. The spec test commands for creating and automatically finding plug-ins have been renamed to make them more self consistent.

#### 3. `conf/bladerunner.conf` will now be generated as `conf/brjs.conf`

Any changes made to the older `bladerunner.conf` file should be transferred to `brjs.conf`.
You are safe to delete `bladerunner.conf` once this has been done, no behaviour has changed, just the name of the config file.
