### Compatibility Issues

#### 1. The PluginAccessor method names for accessing plug-ins have been renamed to always have work 'Plugin' appear within them.

Not doing this was awkward for some of the methods, and it was better to instead provide a consistent set of method names.


#### 2. The spec test commands for creating and automatically finding plug-ins have been renamed to make them more self consistent.
