## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

### Overview

- The `../` prefix has now been removed from all asset/bundle URLs by using a dynamic base tag which is added by including `<@base.tag@/>` in all Aspects and Workbenchs. This is a breaking change from v0.10 to v0.11, see below for more information
- JSDoc toolkit has been updated to v3 and the BRJS JsDoc command is now more configurable
 - We have upgrade to v3.3.0-alpha9, this will be updated to a final 3.3.0 version as soon as it is released
 - The version of JsDoc toolkit used by the command can be overridden by copying the new version of JsDoc toolkit into `conf/jsdoc-toolkit`
 - The JSDoc configuration used by the command can be overridden by creating a `conf/jsdoc-conf.json` file. The default configuration used by BRJS can be copied from `sdk/jsdoc-toolkit-resources/jsdoc-conf.json`
- All assets and bundles are now written to the browser in `UTF-8` format
 - The `browserCharacterEncoding` property from `brjs.conf` has been removed and is a breaking change from v0.10
- Better detection of 'namespaced' JS dependencies
- Fixed some issues with files being locked in Windows that crept back in after the last release
- Fixed a bug where incorrect caching headers were being set for apps that were built as WARs
- Fixed a number of bugs related to import/export app and bladeset commands
- MomentJS has been upgraded to v2.4.0

### Compatibility Issues

#### 1. The `<@base.tag@/>` tag plugin must be used in all Aspects and Workbenches

A `<base>` tag is now used to define the prefix of all asset and bundle URLs. Previous `../` was prepended to all URLs which mean any XHR requests had to explicitly add this prefix. This also now makes it easier to remove the locale suffix for aspect URLs if an app only defines a single locale (https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/issues/692).

`<@base.tag@/>` should now be included in every Aspect and Workbench `index.html` page directly below the `<head>` tag.

#### 2. The `browserCharacterEncoding` option has been removed from `conf/brjs.conf`

`browserCharacterEncoding` should be removed from `conf/brjs.conf` as it's now been removed as configuration option. All content that is sent to the browser is now encoded as `UTF-8` and is no longer configurable.

#### 3. The `export-app` command no longer removes dot files by default

The `export-app` command previously ignored all dot files (`.git` etc.) which resulted in `.js-style` files being ignored during the export and caused the app to subsequently break when imported into a new instance of BRJS. The `export-app` command now uses a whitelist to detirmine whether dot files and folders should be included and can be configured via the `ignoredPaths` property in `conf/brjs.conf`. The current default for this property is `.svn, .git`.
