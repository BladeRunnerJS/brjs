### Known Issues
- CPU usage issues when BRJS server is left running for a prolonged period of time
  - **Workaround:** Restart the BRJS server once every 30-60 minutes
- Due to the latency of the File Watch Service on OSX it can sometimes take several seconds for changes to files to be picked up when a page is refreshed
  - **Workaround:** Either wait a few seconds and refresh the page again, or if you're in a hurry just restart the BRJS server
