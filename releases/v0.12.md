## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

### Overview

- The 'default-aspect' folder at the root level of your application is now optional, the `src`, `theme`, `unbundled-resources` folders and `index.html` file can now be placed at the root of application folder

### Compatibility Issues

#### 1. Namespace rules are now stricter with alias naming.

Previously if we had a require prefix of myapp/mynamespace, alias names such as 'myapp.mynamespace-mystuff' was supported. However it 
will now need to be named 'myapp.mynamespace.mystuff' or an exception will be thrown at runtime.

#### 2. '.js-style' file contents have changed
The 'node.js' token has now been renamed to 'common-js'. There are now two built-in JavaScript styles provided:

  * `common-js`
  * `namespaced-js`
