## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

### Overview

- The `default-aspect` folder at the root level of your application is now optional. Aspect files and folders for the `default-aspect` are now supported directly at the root level of your application, see below:

```
 apps/myApp
 ├── app.conf    # Application configuration
 ├── index.html  # Application entry point
 ├── src         # For app-level JavaScript
 ├── resources   # For other app resources
 ├── themes      # CSS and images
 ├── libs        # Other app libraries
```

- The change to the `default-aspect` is the new default behaviour for any newly created application. 
- Previously created applications which only made use of one aspect (the default-aspect) can migrate their application to this structure by moving all of the folder contents up to the application folder. 
- Package directories that sit under src folders are now optional.

### Compatibility Issues

#### 1. Namespace rules are now stricter with alias naming.

Previously if we had a require prefix of myapp/mynamespace, alias names such as 'myapp.mynamespace-mystuff' was supported. However it 
will now need to be named 'myapp.mynamespace.mystuff' or an exception will be thrown at runtime.

#### 2. '.js-style' file contents have changed
The 'node.js' token has now been renamed to 'common-js'. There are now two built-in JavaScript styles provided:

  * `common-js`
  * `namespaced-js`
