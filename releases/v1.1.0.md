## BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@

BladeRunnerJS @tagVersion@ contains a number of new features along with several bug fixes.

### Tokens replacements can be defined using property files

In previous versions app tokens, for example `@XXX.YYY.ZZZ@`, were only supported in J2EE apps and replaced using a JNDI lookup. Tokens can now be provided using properties files in addition to the existing JNDI mechanism. Tokens can also now be included in any file rather than the limited number of file types previously supported. See [bladerunnerjs.org/docs/use/app_tokens/](http://bladerunnerjs.org/docs/use/app_tokens/) for more information.

### Favicon Support

Favicons (`.favicon` files) located in the root of the app are now served up correctly instead of returning a 404 response.

### JS libraries have been converted to CommonJS

The last few remaining libraries have been converted from the legacy 'NamespacaedJS' format to 'CommonJS'. This will improve the speed of the dependency analysis since calculating the dependencies for CommonJS is much quicker and will remove the need to globalise all modules to support NamespacaedJS modules.

While this doesn't cause a backwards compatibility issue with APIs it may be incompatiable with any custom `js-patches`. Any patches for BRJS libraries will need to be changed to be compatible and, ideally, a pull request against the main codebase raised. 

### Bug Fixes & Minor Improvements

- `_` characters are now supported in version strings supplied via the `-v` flag.
- Cutom error pages configured via `web.xml` are now used correctly in the BRJS development server.
- Performance issues in tests, created in v1.0 by a change to use `<template>` tags in the HTML resource service, have been fixed.
- The `brjs` script works correctly in the latest version of GitBash.
- The `test` command now works correctly with symlinks on *Nix.
- A bug that could cause some CSS resources to not appear in the WAR has been fixed.
- A bug that caused a stackoverflow in IE8 when tests used multiple 'continuesFrom' calls has been fixed. 
- Fields prefixed with `m_` or `_` are now treated as private within Presenter view models and will not be used when calculating child nodes and traversing the model tree.
- Several BRJS microlibraries shipped within BladeRunnerJS have been updated. [Fell](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/fell/releases) has been updated to [v0.1.3](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/fell/releases/tag/v0.1.3), [Topiarist](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/topiarist/releases) to [v0.1.4](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/topiarist/releases/tag/v0.1.4) and [Emitr](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/emitr/releases) to [v0.0.8](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/emitr/releases/tag/v0.0.8).
