# BladeRunnerJS (BRJS)

**Divide & conquer complex web apps**

## Getting Started

The best way to get started depends on why you're here.

* **I want to build an application with BRJS:** Try the [getting started guide](http://bladerunnerjs.org/docs/use/getting_started/).
* **I want to learn more about BRJS:** Head to the [BRJS documentation](http://bladerunnerjs.org/docs/)
* **I'm already familiar with BRJS and want to write a plugin:** Check out the [CommandPlugin tutorial](http://bladerunnerjs.org/docs/extend/command_plugin_tutorial/)
* **I'd like to get the core BRJS development environment set up:** See the [BRJS Core Toolkit Development section](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs#brjs-core-toolkit-development) below.

## Documentation

The main documentation for BRJS can be found via http://bladerunnerjs.org/docs. The source code for the documentation can be found via https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs-site so if you find any error or have any suggestions please submit a pull request.

API reference guides are coming soon.

## BRJS Core Toolkit Development

If you are interested in contributing to the BRJS core toolkit then the following information is of use.

### How to build BRJS

#### Get the code

    git clone git@github.com:BladeRunnerJS/brjs.git
    cd brjs
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

You may need to run `git submodule sync` and `git submodule update` when changing branches if submodules have changed.

#### Install JDK

BRJS is written and compiled using Java 8, but we distribute it and run the tests against it using Java 7, courtesy of [retrolambda](https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda). Because of this, you will need to do the following:

  * Install both Java 7 and Java 8 JDKs.
  * Configure `JAVA7_HOME` to point to the Java 7 JDK home directory.
  * Configure `JAVA8_HOME` to point to the Java 8 JDK home directory.
  * Configure `JAVA_HOME` to point to either the Java 7 or the Java 8 JDK home directory, as you prefer.
  * Configure the `path` environment variable to include `$JAVA_HOME/bin`.

If you install Java using the Windows installer than it places a 'java' executable in 'C:\windows\system32' that proxies to the most recently installed version of Java. You will either need to install your preferred implementation of Java last, or ensure that the path to the Java 'bin' directory appears before 'C:\windows\system32'.



#### Build a Distributable Zip

From the root `brjs` source directory:

    $ ./gradlew cutlass-sdk:distZip
    
The built zip file will be found in `BRJS_ROOT/cutlass-sdk/build/distributions/` in the format `BladeRunner-VERSION.zip`.
