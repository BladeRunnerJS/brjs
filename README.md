## BRJS Core Toolkit Development

If you are interested in contributing to the BRJS core toolkit then the following information is of use.

### How to build BRJS

#### Get the code

    git clone git@github.com:BladeRunnerJS/brjs.git
    cd brjs
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

You may need to run `git submodule sync` and `git submodule update` when changing branches if submodules have changed.

#### Build a Distributable Zip

From the root `brjs` source directory:

    $ ./gradlew cutlass-sdk:distZip
    
The built zip file will be found in `BRJS_ROOT/cutlass-sdk/build/distributions/` in the format `BladeRunner-VERSION.zip`.
