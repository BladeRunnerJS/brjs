Technical overview: the populator

  The populator is a java class (see {{{xref/com/caplin/populator/DatabasePopulator.html}com.caplin.populator.DatabasePopulator}}) with a "main" method. It shares a lot of the same code as the {{{WebcentricServlet.html}WebcentricServlet}}.
  
Running the populator

  The database populator is built as an executable jar that includes all its dependencies. It can be executed something like:
  
+--
java -jar target\webcentric_database_populator-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar <root folder of webcentric xml>
+--

File names, folder structure and "databaseConfigurationSpecification.txt"

  The files, folders and a special file called "databaseConfigurationSpecification.txt" all have to conform to a specific format/naming in order for the populator to work. It isn't particularly nice and is completely unforgiving.
 
File names and folder structure

  The required file names and folder structure are shown below (names inside \<\> are not literal. The others have to be named exactly as shown.)
  
  \<root\> is the root directory of your files used to populate the webcentric_servlet database
  
  \<other layouts\> is one or more files which contain xml for other layouts. Often there is only one. In the example of "databaseConfigurationSpecification.txt" below, 
  this would be the two files "MarketSheet_FX.xml" and "MarketSheet_FI.xml".
  
  (just to be clear, "layouts" is a directory)
  
----------------------------------------
<root>
    databaseConfigurationSpecification.txt
    application.xml
    theme.xml
    layouts
        blank_layout.xml
        <other layouts>
----------------------------------------
  
databaseConfigurationSpecification.txt

  There has to be a file called "databaseConfigurationSpecification.txt" in the root of the folder that contains the files used to populate the webcentric_servlet database.
  The format of this file is shown in this example (line numbers are not included in the file, they are there for reference):
  
----------------------------------------
 1 caplintrader
 2 caplin-trader
 3 New Layout
 4 MarketSheet_FX.xml
 5 Foreign Exchange
 6 MarketSheet_FI.xml
 7 Fixed Income
----------------------------------------

  This explains each line:
  
  [[1]] "caplintrader" - the name of the application
  
  [[2]] "caplin-trader" - the name of the theme
  
  [[3]] "New Layout" - the name of the "new layout" layout (more on that later)
  
  [[4]] "MarketSheet_FX.xml" - the name of a file containing layout xml in the folder "layouts"
  
  [[5]] "Foreign Exchange" - the name of the layout whose xml is specified in "MarketSheet_FX.xml" (ie. the previous line)
  
  [[6]] "MarketSheet_FI.xml" - the name of a file containing layout xml in the folder "layouts"
  
  [[7]] "Fixed Income" - the name of the layout whose xml is specified in "MarketSheet_FI.xml" (ie. the previous line). There are no more lines. 
  End the file with the name of the last layout, not a blank line, otherwise the populator might fail.
