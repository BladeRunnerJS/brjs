Technical overview: the servlet

  The HTTP GET, POST and PUT API implemented for use by webcentric is implemented as a single servlet
  (see {{{xref/com/caplin/webcentric_servlet/WebcentricServlet.html}com.caplin.webcentric_servlet.WebcentricServlet}}).
  
HTTP API

  webcentric relies on the following API to work

* GET

---
/logins/<some login name>
---
  
  For example: {{http://localhost:8080/webcentric_servlet/logins/user1@caplin}}
  
---
/logins/<some login>/pages/<some page id>
---

  For example: {{http://localhost:8080/webcentric_servlet/logins/user1@caplin/pages/1}}

  with the "logins" bits unnecessary and ignored.
  
---
/logins/<some login>/pages
---

  For example: {{http://localhost:8080/webcentric_servlet/logins/user1@caplin/pages}}

** New for webcentric_serlvet - not in webcentric_rails

---
/logins/<some login>/pages/NewLayout
---

  For example: {{http://localhost:8080/webcentric_servlet/logins/user1@caplin/pages/NewLayout}}

  in this case the "logins" value is necessary.
  
* POST

  to be done

* PUT

  webcentric_servlet also provides direct user access - for allowing modification of xml "live" through a web browser. This is password protected for writing but not reading.
