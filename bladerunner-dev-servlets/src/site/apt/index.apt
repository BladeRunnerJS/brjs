What is it for: overview

  webcentric_servlet implements the HTTP GET, POST and PUT API used by webcentric to load and save application, theme and layout XML
  (see {{{WebcentricServlet.html}WebcentricServlet}}).
  
  webcentric_servlet also provides a program that is used to populate the application, theme and layout XML from files
  (see {{{DatabasePopulator.html}DatabasePopulator}})
  
Technical overview

* Hibernate

  webcentric_servlet uses hibernate to map data in a database into objects in Java.
  The database tables and how they map to Java classes are defined in files linked to from hibernate.cfg.xml - for example:
  
+--
<mapping resource="com/caplin/webcentric_servlet/hibernate/Login.hbm.xml"/>
+--
  
  And then have a look at Login.hbm.xml and see:
  
+--
<class name="com.caplin.webcentric_servlet.hibernate.Login" table="logins">
[...]
+--
  
  which shows that table "logins" gets mapped to Java object instances of Login in some way (details beyond the scope of this document).

History

  webcentric_servlet started life as a parallel implementation of "webcentric_rails" - using exactly the same database.
  It has evolved slightly since then; there are things in the schema that could be improved now that it no longer has to
  be compatible with webcentric_rails (on the database side - the HTTP "API" has to remain compatible unless we also
  change webcentric).
