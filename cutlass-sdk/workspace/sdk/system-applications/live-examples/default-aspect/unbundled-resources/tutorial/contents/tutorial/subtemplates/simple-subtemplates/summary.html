<p>
	Sub-templates let you split large HTML structures into smaller chunks, making the <i>View</i> easier to understand. A template is
	simply a top-level HTML tag, such as a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, with an <code>id</code> attribute. It's included in the main View
	template by using a <code>data-bind="template:{}"</code> attribute, which causes the sub-template's contents to be displayed in the
	element that contains the binding.
</p>

<p>
	You can group multiple sub-templates together in a single file, or split them out into separate files.
</p>

<p>
	In this example, a sub-template named <b>amount-template</b> is included in the main template.
