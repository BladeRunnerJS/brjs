<p><i>Presenter's</i> localisation facilities let you configure your app to be displayed in multiple languages, with the correct content,
numeric format and date format for the selected locale (which is usually determined by the locality settings on the user's browser).
Each supported locale must have its own <b>.properties</b> file containing the translated versions of each localisation key.</p>

<p>Presenter lets you localise your app in three ways:</p>


<dl>
	<dt>HTML Template Localisation Tokens:</dt>
	<dd>
		You place these tokens within the HTML View template, inside curly brackets and prefixed by @, and they are replaced by the localised
		value for that token.<br />
		For example: <code>@{tutorial.amount.instruction}</code>
	</dd>

	<dt>API Translation</dt>
	<dd>
		The Presentation Model calls the <code><a target="jsdoc" href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.i18n.Translator.html#getMessage">ct.i18n()</a></code>
		method of the <i>Caplin Localisation Library</i>, using the result to set the value of a property.  Note: <code>ct.i18n()</code> is a global function that provides a shortcut to the
		<code><a target="jsdoc" href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.i18n.Translator.html#getMessage">caplin.i18n.translator.getMessage()</a></code> function.
	</dd>

	<dt>Validators That Support Localisation</dt>
	<dd>
		Some validators accept a localisation token in their constructor, which the Presentation Model can set to ensure
		a localised version of the error message is displayed when an error occurs.
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3>The Example</h3>
<p>The code in this example can access two versions of each localisation token, from a properties file that we have created (see the I18N tab by the side).
The standard versions are as they appear in the code, whereas the alternate versions can be accessed by adding <b>.alt</b> onto the end of each token.</p>

<p class="info">
In Real Life, the tokens would not change, and each localised version would have its own <b>.properties</b> file.
For the purposes of the example, we've fudged things slightly, so that you can see how the Presenter syntax is
used to display different versions of the localisation parameters.
