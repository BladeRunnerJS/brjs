<p>
	<i>Knockout</i> comes with a number of pre-defined binding attributes (e.g. "visible", "click" and "text"), but it also has a plugin
	architecture that allows additional binding attributes to be defined. <i>Presenter</i> ships with a number of plugins to allow integration
	with the Caplin libraries.

<p>
	Although you can write your own plugins, we recommend that you extend <i>Presenter</i> by writing "Custom Controls",
	which are provided by the <i>Control</i> plugin.
