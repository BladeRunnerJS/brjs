<p>
	When you bind a sub-template to an inner
	<code><a href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/caplin.presenter.node.presentationnode.html">PresentationNode</a></code>,
	you don't have to state the property bindings in full, each time; you can just refer to the properties within the template,
	by identifying which higher-level template owns them. This makes
	it easy to re-use the same sub-template for multiple instances of the same object, or for objects with the same properties.
</p>

<p class="info">
	In earlier versions of <i>Presenter</i>, if you wanted a sub-template to use properties
	from a higher level template, you had to declare each required property explicitly in the <code>template{}</code> binding, within
	a set of "<code>templateOptions</code>".  Using the scoping tags below is easier and neater all round.
</p>

<p>
	In this example, the <i>Presentation Model</i> contains an <i><b>account</b></i> field, as well as two child presentation nodes
	(<i><b>leg1</b></i> and <i><b>leg2</b></i>,
	which are instances of <code>TradeLegPresentationNode</code>, defined further down). The child nodes represent legs of a trade with
	different <i><b>amount</b></i> fields. A sub-template is then used to render the contents of each child presentation node, with a
	different scope each time.
</p>

<p>
	You could also use the sub-template to refer to any of its ancestors' scopes using:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>$parent</code> or <code>$parents[0]</code> to refer to the presentation node associated with the current template's parent</li>
	<li><code>$parents[1]</code> to refer to the presentation node associated with the current template's grandparent, etc...</li>
	<li><code>$root</code> to refer to the presentation node associated with the topmost template</li>
</ul>
