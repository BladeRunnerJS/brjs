	Large, complex HTML templates can be broken-down into more manageable parts using sub-templates embedded in HTML fragments,
	which can be retained in the same file as the main template, or within separate files, depending on what works best for you.
	Sub-templates are a standard feature of Knockout; they're embedded, using the <code>data-bind="template:{}"</code> binding.

	Typically, this results in a large interface being broken down into a number of <i>PresenationNode/HTML View</i> pairs.
	This allows small panels (with a common set of controls) to be shared and reused within larger forms.

	Although this is a common structure, there is no requirement for a presentation node to be paired with a sub-template.
