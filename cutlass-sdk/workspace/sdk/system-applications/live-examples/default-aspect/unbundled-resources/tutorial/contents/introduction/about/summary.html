<p>
	Welcome to <i>Presenter Live Examples</i>!  By the time you read this, you will hopefully have read some of the introductory information
	on our main website about <a href="http://www.caplin.com/developer/component/presenter/" target="website">what Presenter is</a>,
	<a href="http://www.caplin.com/developer/component/presenter/getting-started/presenter-introduction" target="website">how it's structured</a>
	and also seen Presenter's version of the traditional
	"<a href="http://www.caplin.com/developer/component/presenter/getting-started/presenter-hello-world" target="website">Hello World</a>"
	example.  There is also a detailed "<a href="http://www.caplin.com/developer/component/presenter/getting-started/presenter-worked-example"
	target="website">worked example</a>", that takes you through the process of creating a real-world trade component using Presenter.
</p>
<p>
	Live Examples gives you something quite different; taking you through individual pieces of Presenter's functionality, and letting you
	experiment with the code in the HTML "<i>View</i>", and the JavaScript "<i>Presentation Model</i>", both of which are in tabs, at the top right of
	the screen.  Every time you alter something, you'll be able to see the result straight away (no "Submit" button required), in the
	bottom-right "Results" area of the screen.
</p>
<p>
	Most of the examples will provide links to the relevant bits of the <a href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.html"
	target="jsdoc">API documentation</a> to tell you about the classes and methods you are using.
