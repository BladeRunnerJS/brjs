<p>
	Some of the properties in a <i>Presentation Model</i>, need to be synchronised with data that originate in the <i>Domain Model</i>. The
	<code>caplin.presenter.domain</code>
	package of the <i>Presenter</i> library, provides factory classes for creating these properties. Properties created in this
	way are automatically synchronised with (i.e. bound to) data in the <i>Domain Model</i>, removing the need to write the synchronisation code.
