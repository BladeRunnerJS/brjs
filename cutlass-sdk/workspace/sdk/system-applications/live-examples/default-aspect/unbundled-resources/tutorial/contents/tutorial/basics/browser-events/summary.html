<p>You can bind browser events (such as a user clicking a button) to methods in the <i>Presentation Model</i>.  These 'event methods'
are invoked every time a particular browser event occurs. The <i>View</i> cannot pass parameters to the invoked method, so event methods
must obtain any necessary data about the state of the UI from the Presentation Model's properties.</p>

<p>This example shows a method that displays an alert message on screen, each time the user clicks the button.</p>
