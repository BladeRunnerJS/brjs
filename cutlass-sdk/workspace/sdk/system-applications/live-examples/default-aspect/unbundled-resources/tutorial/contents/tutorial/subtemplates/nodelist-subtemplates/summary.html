<p>
	Sometimes you'll want to render the same template for each item in a collection (e.g. rows in table or legs in a trade).
	You do this by specifying a
	<code><a href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.node.nodelist.html" target="jsdoc">caplin.presenter.node.NodeList</a></code>
	within the <code>foreach</code> parameter of the template binding. Any changes made to the <code>NodeList</code> are automatically reflected on screen,
	with DOM nodes being created and destroyed as required.
</p>

<p>
	This example creates a
	<code><a href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.node.nodelist.html" target="jsdoc">caplin.presenter.node.NodeList</a></code>
	named <b><i>legs</i></b>, and populates it with two presentation nodes; one for
	each leg. You could of course create a named sub-template for this, as we did in the tutorial on <a href="#tutorial/sub-templates/scoped-subtemplates">Scoped
	Sub-Templates</a>, and use it to iterate through all the items in the <code>NodeList</code>.
</p>

<p>
	However, you don't actually need to define a new named sub-template, if the HTML fragment is not big enough to justify it.
	In this case, the two <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags that comprise the sub-template just sit inside the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> that contains the template
	binding, and it iterates through the <code>NodeList</code> perfectly well.
</p>
