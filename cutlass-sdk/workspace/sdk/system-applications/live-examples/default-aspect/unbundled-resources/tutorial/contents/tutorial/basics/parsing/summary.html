	You can add parsers to a property in order to change its actual value before it is added to the
	Presentation Model (as opposed to Formatters, which merely change the way the values are displayed).
	Multiple parsers can be added to a single property,
	in which case they are executed in the order in which they were added.

<p>
	Caplin provides a set of common parsers in the Renderer library.
	However these are not supplied with BladeRunner, so custom parsers which implement the
	<code><a target="jsdoc" href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.core.parser.html">caplin.core.Parser</a></code>
	interface must be created. This demo uses an <code>UpperCaseParser</code> which converts all lower case letters to upper case.
