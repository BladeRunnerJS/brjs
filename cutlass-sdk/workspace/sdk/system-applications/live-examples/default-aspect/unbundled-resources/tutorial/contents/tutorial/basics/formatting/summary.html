	Formatters are added to a property to change the value as is rendered on screen.
	Multiple formatters can be added to a single property,
	in which case they are executed in the order in which they were added.
	Note that formatters do not alter the actual value of the property, they just alter how it is displayed, such as by using a different
	date format, or (as in this example) rounding off excess decimal places.

	Caplin provides a set of common formatters
	in the <code><a target="jsdoc" href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.element.formatter_2.html">caplin.element.formatter</a></code> package.
	However these are not supplied with BladeRunner, so custom formatters which implement the
	<code><a target="jsdoc" href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.core.formatter.html">caplin.core.Formatter</a></code>
	interface must be created. This demo uses a <code>DecimalFormatter</code> which rounds the value to two decimal places.
