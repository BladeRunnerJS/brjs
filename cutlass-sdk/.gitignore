# TODO: delete these lines when no longer needed -- these lines are needed to work around 2 separate bugs in the Java git implementation (EGit) provided with Eclipse Kepler
#   1. Egit doesn't currently support recursive wildcards (**) as used in the main brjs .gitignore
#   2. Egit currently won't consider recursive matches defined before a blanket block pattern, followed by negated block patterns (!), so is ignoring matches in the main brjs .gitignore
