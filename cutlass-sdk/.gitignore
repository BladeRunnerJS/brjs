# These ignores work such that they exclude files (not direcotries) using *, allowing only explicit includes to override this rule
# See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1248570/git-ignore-everything-except-subdirectory for details

# Note: DO NOT try to use a wildcard to ignore all of workspace. You can't unignore files whose parent directory is ignored.
