<p>
	The Node lists we've looked at so far are all well and good, but they are basically arrays, which is fine when you are using <code>foreach</code>
	to iterate through them, but it does make referring to a specific item a bit of a chore.  Wouldn't it be nice if you had some way of
	mapping a <code>NodeList</code> to a set of names, so that you could refer to an item by its name, rather than just a number in an array?
</p>

<p>
	By a happy coincidence, the
	<code><a href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.node.mappednodelist.html" target="jsdoc">caplin.presenter.node.MappedNodeList</a></code>
	class allows you to do just that!  You just create a list of name/item
	pairs as we've done with "<i><b>nearLeg</b></i>" and "<i><b>farLeg</b></i>", in the <i>Presentation Model</i> of this example, and then call <code>MappedNodeList</code> instead of
	the standard <code>NodeList</code>.
</p>

<p>
	In this example, most things work as they have done with earlier <code>NodeList</code> tutorials, except this time we have added a "Clear NearLeg"
	button.  Notice how the <code>clearNearLegAmount()</code> function identifies the near leg as <code>this.legs.nearLeg</code>, which is a lot easier to understand
	at a glance, than <code>this.legs[0]</code>.
</p>

<p class="warning">
	Knockout doesn't have any concept of an "Observable Map", so you can't refer to list items by name directly from the View
	template, and so (as in this case), you have to call a function in the <i>Presentation Model</i>, and do it from there.
