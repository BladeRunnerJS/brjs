<p>
	A <code><a href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.node.Field.html"
	target="api">Field</a></code>, in <i>Presenter</i>, is an object that comprises several properties that can be addressed as a single entity.
	A <code><a href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.node.Field.html"
	target="api">Field</a></code> is intended to work with an HTML form control, and it contains properties that equate to the attributes of an
	<code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element.
	Encapsulating all these properties within a single <code><a href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.node.Field.html"
	target="api">Field</a></code> means that you don't have to laboriously create each property from scratch.
	A standard <code><a href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.node.Field.html"
	target="api">Field</a></code> includes the following properties:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>controlName:</dt>
	<dd>The logical name of the form control that the field is bound to; it equates to the name attribute of the relevant HTML tag.</dd>

	<dt>enabled:</dt>
	<dd> A Boolean property that determines whether the form control it's bound to is enabled.</dd>

	<dt>hasError:</dt>
	<dd> Another Boolean that flags any validation errors that have been detected.  You can use it to alter the CSS style applied to the element.  Defaults to <i>false</i>.</dd>

	<dt>enabled:</dt>
	<dd>A toggle that determines whether an end-user can enter data into the control.</dd>

	<dt>failureMessage:</dt>
	<dd>An error message displayed to end users if invalid data is entered.</dd>

	<dt>label:</dt>
	<dd>The field description displayed to the end users.</dd>

	<dt>value:</dt>
	<dd>This is the value that the end user enters into the <code>Field</code>.  It equates to the <code>value</code> attribute in HTML.</dd>

	<dt>visible</dt>
	<dd>Another Boolean that controls whether or not the bound element is visible to users.  It default to <i>true</i>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>When you construct a field, the argument (if you include one) is passed to the <code>value</code> property.  All other properties are set to their
defaults.</p>
<p>You can add a validator to the field's <code>value</code> property, to evaluate any data that a user enters. If it fails, the <code>hasError</code>
property will toggle to <i>true</i>, causing the appropriate <code>failureMessage</code> to be displayed.</p>

<p>In this example, a <code>Field</code> called <i><b>amount</b></i> in the <i>Presentation Model</i> is bound to a text box in the <i>View</i>.
The <i>amount</i> field has a <code>label</code> property defined, which is used by the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tag in the View.  It also has
a numeric validator, to check the value of the input.  Note that the <code>label</code> and the <code>failureMessage</code> called by the validator
are both stored in a <i>.properties</i> file, as explained in the <a href="#tutorial/basics/localisation">Localisation</a> example.</p>
<p class="info">A <code>Field</code> is a type of
<code><a href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.node.PresentationNode.html" target="api">Presentation
Node</a></code>. There are other types of node within Presenter, that match up to HTML form controls.  They are known as <a href="#tutorial/control-models">Control Models</a>,
and you'll find out more about them later on. </p>
