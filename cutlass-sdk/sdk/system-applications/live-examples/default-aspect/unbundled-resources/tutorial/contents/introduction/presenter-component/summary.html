<p>
	To use Presenter, you need to create two things: the HTML template with <code>data-bind</code> attributes and the Presentation Model.
	You then create a Presenter Component using them.  You can read more about the Presenter Component in the
	<a href="http://www.caplin.com/developer/component/presenter/getting-started/presenter-creating-a-presenter-component" target="website">Creating
	a Presenter component</a>, and a detailed example showing you how to do it is provided in the
	<a href="http://www.caplin.com/developer/component/presenter/getting-started/presenter-worked-example#pres_we_1" target="website">Presenter
	Worked Example</a>.
</p>

<h2>The HTML Template (View)</h2>

<p>The <i>View</i> is just a fragment of HTML5, with <code>data-bind</code> attributes to connect DOM elements to JavaScript
objects in the <i>Presentation Model</i>.  The file containing the View, along with other HTML resources, is stored in a blade's
<i>resources/html</i> directory, and the top-level HTML element within the View must have a correctly formatted <code>id</code>
attribute, in order to be properly referenced by the Presenter Component.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.caplin.com/developer/component/presenter/getting-started/presenter-creating-a-presenter-component#view" target="website">Creating
	a Presenter component</a> for further details.


<h2>Presentation Model</h2>

<p>The <i>Presentation Model</i> JavaScript file sits in a folder with the same name as the blade it belongs to, under the <i>/src/</i> directory.<br />
E.g: <i>test-bladeset/blades/myblade/src/ ... /myblade/pres_model.js</i></p>

<p>The file has to be set up as a presentation model by including a class that extends
<code><a target="jsdoc" href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.presentationmodel.html">caplin.presenter.PresentationModel</a></code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.caplin.com/developer/component/presenter/getting-started/presenter-creating-a-presenter-component#pm" target="website">Creating
	a Presenter component</a> for further details.


<h2>Binding them together into a Presenter Component</h2>

<p>
	To do this, you need to create an instance of a
	<code><a target="jsdoc" href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.component.PresenterComponent.html">caplin.presenter.component.PresenterComponent</a></code>
	that uses the HTML template and the presentation model defined above.
	There are three ways of including the Presenter Component in an application or webpage:

	</ol>
