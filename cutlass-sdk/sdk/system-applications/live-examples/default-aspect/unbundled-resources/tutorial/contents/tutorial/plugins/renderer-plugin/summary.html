	It's often the case that all an application's components and controls, conform to common formatting and
	validation rules (e.g. displaying currency amounts and dates). Caplin allows a common central renderer definition to
	be defined in XML and shared between components. The <i>Renderer</i> plugin allows you to directly embed renderers in
	views. For further information see the document on the Caplin support site:

<p class="info">
	When using a plugin, <code>value:</code> must be used for <code>data-bind</code> rather than <code>text:</code>.
</p>

<p class="warning">
	If you're creating a trading application with streaming prices displayed on the screen, you should always use
	renderers to display these data. They include advanced throttling functionality and ensure that users trade on the
	prices displayed on the screen when the browser is under high load.
