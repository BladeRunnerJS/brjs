	It's sometimes useful to be able to restore a user interface to a previous state, such as when you want a trade ticket to be reset
	to its initial state when a trade completes. This can be achieved by creating a collection of all the properties that make up the
	<i>Presentation Model</i>, and using the
	<code><a href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/caplin.presenter.property.snapshot.html" target="jsdoc">caplin.presenter.property.Snapshot</a></code>
	class, to store the current values of each of them. Later the snapshot can be restored, using the <code>apply()</code> method.
</p>

<p>
	Only <a href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/caplin.presenter.property.writableproperty.html" target="jsdoc">writable</a>
	(or <a href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/caplin.presenter.property.editableproperty.html" target="jsdoc">editable</a>)
	properties are stored within snapshots, since
	<a href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/caplin.presenter.property.property.html" target="jsdoc">simple properties</a>
	can't be changed from their original values in any case.
</p>

<p>
	In this example, the initial state of the ticket is saved at the end of the constructor. Note how the
	<code><a href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/caplin.presenter.property.properties.html" target="jsdoc">properties()</a></code>
	method is invoked with no arguments, causing all descendent properties to be stored.
