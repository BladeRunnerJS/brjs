<p>
	The <code><a target="jsdoc" href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.node.button.html">caplin.presenter.node.Button</a></code> stores the state of a button and allows
	properties, such as its visibility, to be set via the model.
</p>
<p>
	Try changing some of the properties in the example below.
</p>

<p class="info">
	You don't have to declare the status of the <code>enable </code>and <code>visible </code>properties in the <code>data-bind</code> statement,
	if you only want them to keep their default settings; but if you do want to manipulate them using the <i>Presentation Model</i>, the properties
	must be declared in the <i>View</i>.
