<p>
	Sometimes, whether or not the value of a field is allowable will depend on the values of other fields or properties.
	For instance, you might have two fields (let's call them <i>min</i> and <i>max</i>) that set the minimum and maximum values allowed
	for a third field, which we'll call <i>amount</i>. If the user changes any of those fields, so that <i>amount</i> is no longer higher
	than <i>min</i> and lower than <i>max</i>, you'll want to display an error.

<h3>Cross-Property Validation in Presenter</h3>
<p>
	In Presenter, this concept of validating related values is called <i><b>Cross-Property Validation</b></i>.  As you might recall from the tutorial
	section, a <code>Field</code> in <i>Presenter</i> is a collection of <code>Property</code> instances (<code>value</code>, <code>visible</code>,
	and so on), and <i>validators</i> are attached to properties.
	When you attach a validator to a field's <code>value</code> property, any validation errors propagate to the <code>Field</code> itself, setting the values of its
	<code>hasError</code> and <code>failureMessage</code> properties appropriately.
</p>
<p>
	To perform Cross-Property Validation, first you have to create a class that implements the
	<code><a target="jsdoc" href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.validator.crosspropertyvalidator.html">caplin.presenter.validator.CrossPropertyValidator</a></code>
	interface. However, unlike a normal
	<code><a target="jsdoc" href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.core.validator.html">caplin.core.Validator</a></code>,
	you don't attach an instance of a Cross-Property Validator directly to every property. 	Instead, use the <code>bindValidator()</code> method on the global singleton
	<code><a target="jsdoc" href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.validator.crossvalidationpropertybinder.html">caplin.presenter.validator.CrossValidationPropertyBinder</a></code>,
	which manages and binds Cross-Property Validators. This example will show you how this is done, with comments in the code itself to help clarify the details.

	Some additional points:
	<ul>
		<li>
			When writing a new Cross-Property Validator, you should specify exactly what mappings <code>mProperties</code>
			is expected to contain, both in your documentation and to other developers, since it will differ for each new type of validator.
			You should also implement the <code>validate()</code> method to expect some properties to be missing and to handle
			the case when they are.
		</li>
		<li>
			After binding a Cross-Property Validator, the effect of the binding on any
			<code><a target="jsdoc" href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.property.editableproperty.html">caplin.presenter.property.EditableProperty</a></code>
			is the same as if a normal validator was added to it with its <code>addValidator()</code> method. This means
			that the order in which validators are run is respected, as with normal validators.
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>In this example, when a cross-validation error occurs, all the properties are affected.
Errors are then styled using the following stylesheet:
</p>

<pre>
.error{
    border:1px solid red !important;
}

.error_msg{
    color:red !important;
}
</pre>

</div>
