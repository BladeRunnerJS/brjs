<p>If you need an end-user to be able to enter or update the value of a property, you will need to use an <b>Editable Property</b>, which allows the value
of the property to be updated in the View, and passed back to the Presentation Model:</p>

<p><code><a target="jsdoc" href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.property.EditableProperty.html">caplin.presenter.property.<b>EditableProperty</b></a></code></p>

<p>This class is an extension of
<code><a target="jsdoc" href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.property.WritableProperty.html">caplin.presenter.property.<b>WritableProperty</b></a></code>,
and has all the methods available to either <b>simple</b> or <b>writable</b> properties.  Because you may want to be alerted when a user changes something,
parse the input so that it can be processed, and indeed check that the change is valid; Editable properties also have a number of additional methods.</p>

<p>In this example, our amount property is now an <code>EditableProperty</code>, and it is now bound to an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element in the HTML View.
Note that the <code>data-bind</code> now says <code>"value:amount"</code> rather than <code>"text:amount"</code>, because our <code>amount</code> property is
now occupying the <code>value</code> attribute of an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element, instead of the textual content of a container tag, like a
<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>So that we can see that changing the value has been noticed by the system, we've added a function called <code>_onAmountChange()</code>, which is called
using the <code>addChangeListener()</code> method, which alerts us when a change is made.  The <code>addChangeListener()</code> method, by the way,
belongs to <code><a target="jsdoc" href="/dashboard-services/jsdoc/index.html#caplin.presenter.property.Property.html">caplin.presenter.property.<b>Property</b></a></code>, and its details can be located in that section of the API reference.</p>
