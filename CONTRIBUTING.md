# Contributing to BladeRunnerJS (BRJS)

Firstly, thanks! It's great that you're interested in contributing to BRJS.

Contributing to the BRJS codebase is really easy. We only have one hard rule: **there must be tests** as part of any code related pull request. Other than that we'd like the following as part of any contribution:

* Make commits of logical units
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing
* Run all the tests for the project before making the pull request

When you submit a pull request please submit into `develop` rather than `master` - the BRJS uses develop for day to day work, only merging to master for releases. If you have built from a feature branch and want to submit a pull request into that feature branch feel free to submit a PR to that branch instead.


The following information will also be of use:

* [How the BRJS team use Github and git](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/wiki/How-do-we-use-GitHub-and-Git%3F)
* [BRJS core developer setup](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/wiki/BRJS-Developer-Setup)
* BRJS usage documentation is maintained on the [brjs-site github repo](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs-site) and contributions can also be made there

For more information about contributing please see the [BRJS wiki](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/wiki/).
